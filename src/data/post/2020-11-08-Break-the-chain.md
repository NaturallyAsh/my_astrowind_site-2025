Whats up everyone, and welcome to my first newbie post!! I wanted to share my experience that new programming learners might find helpful. A few months after I began learning R and python, I started to become discouraged. I couldn't understand why I felt like I wasn't retaining or remembering much of what I learned from courses and tutorials. When I stopped taking tutorial after tutorial and started creating small side projects, concepts that I learned, yet couldn't quite grasp, began to click. My skills improved drastically and my confidence grew. And I must say, there's nothing more gratifying than finally being able to write a script from memory then screaming to no one in particular, "Huzzah!! Look at me and my bad self!"

Tutorials and courses are great at teaching you the basics, but the mastery comes when you apply what you learned to real-world projects. It’s also much more fun :grinning: My advice - don’t get stuck in tutorial hell! BREAK THE CHAIN!!
